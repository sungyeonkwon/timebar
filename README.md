# Timebar CLI

A CLI to get some time progress bars to ponder over in your terminal. Pretty much an extension of what [this twitter bot](https://twitter.com/year_progress) is doing, reminding you that time is passing by ðŸ˜±

## Installation

### From [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/timebar)

```
cargo install timebar
```

### From source

You need cargo to compile from source, which is shipped with Rust.

```
git clone https://github.com/sungyeonkwon/timebar
cargo install --path ./timebar # Compile and install
```

## Basic Usage

Timer and life progress bar update every second until you exit the program, while year and dday progress bar update once and the program exits.

### Year progress

To get this year's progress bar, run `timebar year`.

```
â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–‘ 97.7%

This year's almost over!
```

### Life progress

To get your life's progress bar, run `timebar life`. This prompts to enter your name, birthday and expected lifespan.

```
â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ 51.1%

Brian is expected to exist on this planet for 70 years.

Time remaining:

34 in years
411 in months
1786 in weeks
12502 in days
300057 in hours
18003447 in minutes
1080206822 in seconds.

Have a good day!
```

### Timer progress

To get a timer progress bar, run `timebar timer`. This prompts to enter duration.

```
â–“â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ 1.5%

Time is ticking... You have:

0 in hours
5 in minutes
325 in seconds.
```

### D-day progress

To get a d-day progress bar, run `timebar dday`. This prompts to enter a name and the dates.

```
â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ 74.1%

graduation: 541 days are gone, 189 days to go!
```

## Manage entries

Life and d-day can be saved. Data is written to flat files under the active user's home directory (See [preferences](https://docs.rs/preferences/1.1.0/preferences/) library).

#### Save

To save an entry, run `timebar life -s` for a life and `timebar dday -s` for a d-day. Once the information is successfully saved, you'll get the time bar just running `timebar life {NAME}` or `timebar dday {NAME}` next time.

#### List

To get a list of previously saved d-days and lives, run `timebar ls`.

```
TYPE        | NAME        | DURATION
life        | Brian       | 101 years
d-day       | big-trip    | 28/1/1999 - 29/12/2023
d-day       | tiny-battle | 3/12/2020 - 29/12/2022
d-day       | launch      | 3/1/2020 - 29/12/2021
```

#### Remove

To remove a specific previously-saved data, run `timebar rm {NAME}`.
To remove all saved data, run `timebar rm -a`.
